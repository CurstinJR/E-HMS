# Electronic Healthcare Management System (E-HMS)

## Problem Statment
We all know that a hospital is concerned with the patient's life and health. Excellent medical treatment is dependent on highly trained doctors, nurses, and high-quality facilities and equipment, as well as accurate record keeping. Diseases are becoming more prevalent, making it difficult for physicians to prescribe medications; one incorrect judgment might result in patient death. In most hospitals, records concerning a patient's illness are saved on paper, so retrieving a patient's history is difficult, and physically searching for a record takes a lot of time and effort, and one of the biggest challenges in hospitals is that patients do not care about their medical records. 

They misplace their medical papers (prescriptions), requiring the patient to retestand re-check himself in accordance with his ailments. A doctor may have to go through a lot of difficulty to uncover the true cause of a patient's ailment if they do not have an accurate, and up-to-date patient medical record. In other words, medical workers may not provide the optimal therapy or may misdiagnose a patient. Record keeping is an essential component of every organisation's day-to-day operation. Good records help guarantee that the administration of hospitals runs smoothly.

## Solution
We propose an E-Health Management System that will provide an efficient solution forcarrying out hospital management while meeting the needs and requirements of all stakeholders such as doctors, patients, and staffs by incorporating the following features:

 - Patient Appointment Management
 - Doctors' appointment scheduling
 - Identify and maintain patient records
 - Manage patient medical history such as reports, prescriptions
 - Patient medical records Security and privacy
 - Physician Profile Management
 - Appointments reminder management
 - Patient Billing management
